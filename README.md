# A visualization of _The Traveling Salesman Problem_

https://michaelarn0ld.github.io/pathfinder-app/

**Version 1.0.0**

Given a graph with a specified starting and ending location, find the cycle of minimum length that visits each vertice.

This application is an implementation of the infamous _Traveling Salesman Problem_. The user will place a starting node, an ending node, and intermediate "detour" nodes; the program will then find the shortest path to complete the path. Optionally, the user may also place wall nodes in the gridspace.
